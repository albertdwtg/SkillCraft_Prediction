# SkillCraft_Prediction

Project testing our knowledge in machine learning by teams of 2 students. We had to clean the data, visualize it with different librairies and train some machine learning algorithms.<br/>
<br/>
After the end of the project, i wanted to improve our results, that's why i created the "simplified" file. In this file, i have just tested more algorithms and improved my personal functions. I have also done some feature engineering, thing we hadn't done on the first version.
